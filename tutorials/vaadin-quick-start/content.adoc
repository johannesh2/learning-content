In this tutorial, you learn how to build a small but fully functional Vaadin application. This example teaches you the basics of component-based development and listening to events.

The application you build is the classic Todo application.

== Prerequisites

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html[Java 8 or later,window=_blank]

== Download a minimal Vaadin project

https://pages.vaadin.com/hubfs/1840687/my-app.zip[Download^, role="button button--bordered quickstart-download-project"]

Once you have the project downloaded, unzip the file e.g. to your home directory. For now, you don’t need to install any IDE or application server. We’ll use a simple embedded Java server to run the app and a text editor to edit the source code.

The project folder has a few files and folders, many of them related to dependency and project configuration. In this tutorial, we are only interested in our UI code in `src/main/java/com/vaadin/example/MainView.java`

In the project root folder, run `mvnw` script. The script compiles the project and runs the application on an embedded Jetty server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080, rel="nofollow"]`, and you should see a basic Vaadin application with a button.

We are now ready to start building the app.

== Building UIs with components and layouts
Open `src/main/java/com/vaadin/example/MainView.java` in a text editor

Vaadin is a component-based framework. You construct user interfaces by instantiating components and putting them into layouts that determine how they get shown. `MainView` extends `VerticalLayout`. It means that each added component gets placed underneath the previous one. Vaadin adds padding around the layout and components for visual clarity.

Replace the code in MainView with the code below:

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
package com.vaadin.example;

import com.vaadin.flow.component.Key;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.button.Button;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.checkbox.Checkbox;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.textfield.TextField;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.orderedlayout.HorizontalLayout;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.orderedlayout.VerticalLayout;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.html.H1;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.Route;

@Route
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

  public MainView() {
    VerticalLayout todosList = new VerticalLayout(); // (1)
    TextField taskField = new TextField(); // (2)
    Button addButton = new Button("Add"); // (3)
    addButton.addClickShortcut(Key.ENTER);
    addButton.addClickListener(click -> {
      // (4)
      Checkbox checkbox = new Checkbox(taskField.getValue());
      todosList.add(checkbox);
    });
    add( // (5)
      new H1("Vaadin Todo"),
      todosList,
      new HorizontalLayout(
        taskField,
        addButton
      )
    );
  }
}

---- 
<1> `todosList` is a vertical layout that displays the task and checkboxes
<2> `taskField` is the text input field for new tasks
<3> `addButton` triggers logic to add new items to our list of todo items
<4> In the listener for the button click, create a checkbox with the value from the `taskField` as its label.
<5> Call `add` on the VerticalLayout to define how the components should be displayed. Notice that `taskField` and `addButton` are in a `HorizontalLayout`, which puts them next to each other.

If you still have your server running, kill the process and rerun the `mvnw` script.

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080, rel="nofollow"]` and you should see the following:

== Next steps
For developing more complex applications, we recommend using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. Before deploying your application to production, the assets should be minified and bundled. These topics and many more are covered in our tutorials and video courses.
